									<h3>I. MATCHING PREFERENCES</h3>
									<p>SEND IT ON will match you with our mentees based on your interests and the initial meeting. You will be contacted and a meeting will be set up to discuss the potential mentor/mentee match that has been identified. Communication processes will also be discussed.</p>
									<h3>II. MATCH MEETING</h3>
									<p>Virtually meet your mentee! Get to know who they are and begin developing a relationship.</p>
									<h3>III. BEGIN TO SEND IT ON!</h3>
									<p>Once your mentee and you have connected, you can continue to independently set times with your mentee to meet on a weekly/bi-weekly basis. This can be for 20 minutes, or 40 mins, it is up to you and your schedule! Each month, you will also be attending SEND IT ON personal development webinars (-30 mins) which equips you with skills, knowledge, and tools that empower both you and your mentee as you learn to foster and create an environment for change and growth. These sessions can also be a place for debrief.</p>

									<h3>I. POSITION ATTAINMENT</h3>
									<p>SEND IT ON will reach out to you after the initial meeting to discuss your preferred position based on your interests.</p>
									<h3>II. BEGIN TO SEND IT ON!</h3>
									<p>After position attainment, you will begin attending executive meetings (with to-do tasks) and personal development webinars (-30 mins) which each occur once a month. We also strongly encourage our board members to mentor a youth. However, as our executives also take on other tasks, we offer a dual mentoring option. In this option, you pair up with another executive to mentor ONE youth together, decreasing the task load!</p>
