# Send-IT-ON-WEBSITE

For this project, I was helping my sister build a website for students in third-world countries to connect with students in North America to share experiences and mentor each other for growth. I created an interactive website that attracted students and delivered information. It was the first website I ever built myself and I was really proud of the end product and of myself for how much I learned. Moreover, I felt amazing being part of such an incredible project which had the potential to change lives and help the next generation.
