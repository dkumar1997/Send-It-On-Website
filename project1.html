            <h2>ABOUT BUSIA</h2>
            <div class="image-write">
              <p>“Busia is a town in the eastern region of Uganda with approximately 893,681 residents. Nationally, Busia borders Lake Victoria to the south-west, Siaya to the south-east, and Kakamega and Bungoma to the east. Educationally, Busia currently has over 420 primary schools and over 90 secondary schools. This allows youth to attain schooling experience and education. However, Busia currently does not have adequate healthcare facilities to serve the entirety of their population as the neighboring districts of Uganda also share such resources. This leads to low health literacy levels and inadequate management of health, increasing school drop-out rates and illness. Economically, Busia has thriving trade centers in which livestock, agricultural products, and manufactured goods are traded through the main economic activities of subsistence farming and fishing.” <br>- Alice Pape, Global Partner

              <p>“The youth in Busia are resilient. They want to move forward and continue to grow despite their circumstances. They are happy, they are full of life, and they are the heart of our community, shining through life’s obstacles and showing immense gratitude. For this, we cherish them.” - Alice Pape</p>

            <h2>PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT</h2>
            <div class="image-write">
              <p>Youth in the Busia community face multiple challenges. This includes a loss of parents, HIV, stigma, and lack of educational support. In partnership with Alice Pape, a social worker and community nurse in Busia, Uganda, SEND IT ON aims to build trusting relationships and provide psychosocial support to youth as guided by Alice. SEND IT ON will do this by ensuring that mentors are equipped with the knowledge and skills to create a space of gratitude and purpose.</p>
