          <h2>Mentorship</h2>
          <p>“A mentor empowers a person to see a possible future, and believe it can be obtained” -Shawn Hitchcock</p>
          <p>Mentorship is instrumental in supporting personal growth, career strategizing, and mutuality (Kram &amp; Isabella, 1985). As the research suggests, mentorship is a two-sided relationship, rendering it vital and significant. In the sphere of personal growth, mentorship offers psychosocial support, friendship, and collaboration, providing “the chance to express one’s personal and professional dilemmas, vulnerabilities, and individuality” (Kram &amp; Isabella, 1985, p.120). As social psychologists have noted, individuals develop the self and their personality through a social nexus of relationships, including those of mentorship. 

  From a literature review conducted by the Mental Health Coordinating Council (2014), successful elements of a mentorship program include (1) a structural component: dedicated/protected scheduled times of meeting, (2) a relationship component: involvement of participant in the planning of the program, non-hierarchical relationship between mentors/mentees, conversational socialization, and focus on rapport building, and (3) a learning environment: creating a safe and supportive space for reflection and growth. These elements have been endorsed by and integrated into the SEND IT ON program framework. Through our online weekly educational sessions, collaboration with global community members, and providing youth an active voice in program development, our program has been founded on the pillars of support, encouragement, and engagement. Ongoing training and workshops are robustly supported in the literature for successful program enhancement, including effectiveness in maintaining matches, increasing mentor and mentee satisfaction, and increasing mentor and mentee perceptions on the quality of their relationship (DuBois, Holloway, Valentine, &amp; Cooper, 2002; DuBois,Portillo, Rhodes,Silverthorn, &amp; Valentine, 2011; Kanchewa, Rhodes, Schwartz, 2014). </p>

          <h2>Importance of Growth Mindset</h2>
          <p>“Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed no hope at all, this is the perseverance of a growth mindset” - Dale Carnegie </p>
          <p>A shift towards a growth mindset is associated with a variety of adaptive motivational beliefs and achievement outcomes (Dweck, 2000; Kamins &amp; Dweck, 1999; Yeager  &amp; Dweck, 2012). In a study by Schmidt, Shumow, and Kackar-cam (2017), findings revealed that students began building a growth mindset through mindset interventions. Their mindsets showed significantly different trajectories of skill, control, learning, and interest relative to their peers in control conditions. This suggests that growth mindsets have the power to empower youth as they enhance their ability to learn, create, and innovate. Youth with growth mindsets also practiced higher levels of gratitude, resulting in greater joy and fulfilment. Further, a study by Burnette, Russell, Hoyt, Orvidas, and Widman (2017) found that girls who completed an online mindset intervention reported stronger growth mindsets compared to girls in a matched control programme. Within this study, girls that received the mindset intervention also reported greater efficacy and learning motivation. 
SEND IT ON collectively uses these interventions in the literature as effective methods to equip our mentors with knowledge and skills in cultivating environments which support the development of such mindsets for the mentees.

          <h2>Importance of Sharing Perspectives and Enhancing Diversity</h2>
          <p>“Strength lies in differences, not in similarities” - Stephen R. Covey </p>
          <p>Many studies in the literature highlight the importance of friendship and contact with diverse peers (Fabes, Martin, &amp; Hanish, 2018). The research suggests that there are longitudinally positive effects of such contacts as they promote inclusion and help youth gain a sense of belongingness while reducing injustice and exclusion. In a literature review of 159 studies, Ehrich, Hansford, and Tennent (2004) found that through mentorship relationships, collegiality and networking are enhanced with professional development, reflection, and perspective sharing as few of the many benefits. Further, a dissertation by Washington et al. (2019) noted that in enhancing perspectives and embracing diversity within a program, mentors and mentees become more open-minded and are able to better effectively communicate. 

In connecting with global communities, SEND IT ON aims to culturally enrich mentorship relationships. Through situating SEND IT ON bases in different communities across the world, youth of diverse cultures, traditions, values, and beliefs are connected with the SEND IT ON family in Canada. This process is essential in building a successful program which the SEND IT ON partners work hard to ensure.
