            <h2>ABOUT TURKANA</h2>
            <div class="image-write">
              <p>“Turkana County is situated in the North Western part of Kenya. The County borders West Pokot, Baringo, Samburu and Marsabit County. Internationally it borders South Sudan, Uganda, and Ethiopia. Turkana’s people are faithful and happy citizens that work together to create a culturally rich environment of support, family, and encouragement. However, some of the challenges faced as a community include drought, inadequate water, inadequate infrastructural facilities, and most importantly, a lack of education and low literacy levels. The low literacy levels of 22.2% in the county can be attributed to causes including extreme poverty, high dependency ratios, understaffing in schools, and cultural practices such as forced marriages. As a result, our youth need professionally diverse discussions to help them understand the importance of embracing education, which is a noble course that is not given close attention. Fortunately, most of the challenges above can be positively addressed through empowerment and education”<br>-Leah Lokala, Global Partner

                <p class="aboutme">“I am from Turkana County of Kenya in East African Region. I am currently teaching at Kibabii University in the department of Business Administration and Management through my Masters degree in Bungoma. I am also in the administrators office for the school of graduate studies in collaboration with graduate students. 
A personal story that I would like to share with you is from when I was walking to school with tone shoes and passing through a dry river full of sand. My friend and I got so many blisters due to the hot sand that we cried until we couldn’t. I went to school not knowing why I was there because my mama prepared me to go to school but did not understand what my marks or progress meant. A mentor would have been helpful to guide me and create a plan with me for my future studies. As I did not have this person and many youth still currently do not, I decided to transform my community as I have had first-hand experience of these challenges. I created a team with students of mine to help educate, mentor, and provide discussion to the youth and young adults of Turkana. When SEND IT ON reached out to me, I thought this was the perfect opportunity for the youth to hear from professionally diverse students that can help the youth in Turkana better understand the importance of education so that they can make a change in their community.” -Leah Lokala
