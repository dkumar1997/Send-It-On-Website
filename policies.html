              <p>At SEND IT ON a diverse, inclusive, and equitable workplace is one where all volunteers, whatever their gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, sexual orientation or identity, education or disability, feels valued and respected. Our organization recognizes its talented and diverse team as key members. Our success is a reflection of the quality and skill of our people. We are committed to a nondiscriminatory approach and provide equal opportunity for advancement in all programs and opportunities. We strive to create and foster a supportive and understanding environment in which all individuals realize their maximum potential within the organization, regardless of their differences. We respect and value diverse life experiences and heritages and ensure that all voices are valued and heard.</p>

              <h3>1.3. Policy Enforcement</h3>
              <p>To provide informed, authentic leadership for cultural equity, SEND IT ON strives to:</p>
              <h4>Enforce</h4>
              <p>We acknowledge and dismantle any inequities within our policies, systems, and programs, and continually update and report organization progress. We help to challenge assumptions about what it takes to be a strong leader at our organization. We also advocate for and support board-level thinking about how systemic inequities impact our organization’s work, and how best to address that in a way that is consistent with our mission.
              SEND IT ON also develops and presents sessions on diversity, inclusion, and equity to provide information and resources internally and to the community. We also develop a system for being more intentional and conscious of bias during the onboarding and evaluating process of mentors and leadership teams. As such, we train our mentor coordinators on equitable practices.</p>
              <h4>Monitor</h4>
              <p>We explore potential underlying, unquestioned assumptions that interfere with inclusiveness and include such education in our training sessions. We commit time and resources to expand more diverse leadership within our board, mentors, committees, and advisory bodies.</p>
              <h4>Review</h4>
              <p>SEND IT ON reviews the diversity policy with the leadership team on an annual basis. We also generate and aggregate qualitative research related to equity
              to make incremental, measurable progress toward the visibility of our diversity, inclusion, and equity efforts.</p>

We will facilitate those who may not have the capacity to articulate grievance or complaints, and complaints procedures will be readily accessible.</p>

              <h3>1.3. Managing the Complaint</h3>
              <ul class="ourresp">
                <li>Upon receiving a complaint, we will acknowledge your matter via email within 72 hours </li>
                <li>If your complain is urgent, we will work to address it as soon as possible</li>
                <li>We will keep you informed of the progress of your complaint, proposed actions and the expected timeframe for resolution</li> 
                <li>Our aim is to resolve the complaint in a timely manner and we will generally resolve a matter within 30 calendar days</li>
                <li>We will advise you of the outcome of your complaint via email</li>
              </ul>
              <p>To provide informed, authentic leadership for cultural equity, SEND IT ON strives to:</p>
          
              
              <h4>Step One</h4>
              <p>Should you have a complaint on any aspect of the organization's programs, we urge you to email us at int.senditon@gmail.com. We hope to resolve the vast majority of enquiries or complaints during your first contact with us.</p>
              <h4>Step Two: Resolution of Complaint at Point of Contact or Further Investigation </h4>
              <p>Complaints made to the organization are overseen by the executive team. If a complaint is not immediately solved, we will escalate the complaint to the relevant leadership team. If a complainant makes a complaint in confidence, the identity of the complainant will only be known to the recipient of the complaint and the relevant manager. All anonymous complaints, both written and verbal, will be documented and brought to the attention of the relevant manager for a decision as to whether quality improvements are required on the basis of the complaint.</p>
              <p>The complaints investigation process may involve:</p>
              <ul class="ourresp" style="margin-left: 7%; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                <li>Interview/s with the complainant giving them an opportunity to give their version of events and to provide evidence/explanations in relation to their actions.</li>
                <li>Interview/s with other relevant parties giving them an opportunity to give their version of events and to provide evidence/explanations in relation to their actions.</li>
                <li>Giving the complainant the opportunity to identify what they would like to happen as a result of making the complaint</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This overall process may take approximately 21 days throughout which we will keep the complainant updated. The team leader will record the actions taken to resolve the complaint in the complaints log. Where the complaint can be managed informally, the relevant manager will seek the consent of the complainant and any other person to whom the complaint relates, to find an informal resolution of the complaint.</p>
              <h4>Step Three</h4>
              <p>When your complaint is resolved, we will confirm this with you within 5 business days, at which point we will also ask for your feedback. We will produce a draft report of the background information on the complaint, the sequence of events, the findings, and recommendations which are considered appropriate. The leadership team will work with relevant others to develop an action plan based on any recommendations in the report.</p>

            <section id="1.4c">
              <h3>1.4. Vexatious or Malicious Complaints</h3>
              <p>The complaints handling process will provide protection and support to a person or service where it is deemed that a complaint has been made without sufficient grounds or with the conscious desire to cause harm to that person or service. SEND IT ON views the making of a malicious or vexatious complaint against any team member with the utmost seriousness.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="1.5c">
              <h3>1.5. Redress</h3>
              <p>An effective complaints system which offers a range of timely and appropriate remedies will enhance the quality of membership service to people. It will have a positive effect on team morale and improve relations with the general public 

                We will offer forms of redress or responses that are appropriate and reasonable where it has been established that a measurable loss, detriment or disadvantage was suffered or sustained by the claimant personally. 
              </p>
              <p>This redress could include:</p>
              <ul class="ourresp" style="margin-left: 7%; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                <li>Apology</li>
                <li>An explanation</li>
                <li>Admission of fault</li>
                <li>Change of decision</li>
                <li>Correction of misleading or incorrect records</li>
                <li>Technical assistance</li>
                <li>Change in procedure</li>
                <li>Recommendation to make a change to a relevant policy</li>

              <h3>1.6. Learning from Complaints</h3>
              <p>SEND IT ON  is committed to learning from complaints and will view each complaint as an opportunity for quality improvement. The leadership team will monitor the complaints received and ensure that complaints are discussed at team meetings as appropriate for the purpose of learning and service improvement.</p>
